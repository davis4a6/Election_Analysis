## Challenge Overview
My biggest challenge with this analysis was learning how to manage the little things such as indentation in python. Another challenge I had was getting my results from the terminal to match the results in my text file. The biggest thing that I learned was that the little things make the most difference. 
## Challenge Summary
Overall, this analysis was fun and challenging. This can be used for any election when you want to figure out the total number of candidates and votes for each candidate. It is also good for when you want to break up the different counties or cities that each candidate received votes from. This way it would be easy for the candidate to know where their biggest supporters are located.
